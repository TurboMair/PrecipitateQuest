* Professor Dolf prepares them for the challenge:
1. A precipitation reaction is an exchange reaction with two soluble ionic compounds.
2. Real examples such as kidney stone formation, enamel, and bone formation.
3. Examples of removing ions from the environment such as Pb2+.
* The Challenge begins: They are on one side of an Indiana Jones type obstacle. There are holes in the floor with water (and alligators) in them.

* Professor Dolf throws an ion in the first hole. They have to add a soluble ionic compound that will form a precipitate. If solid forms, it will sink and move a lever that inserts a sheet of plexiglass a few inches below the surface of the water. They will be able to walk on it. If no solid forms, they will fall in and be eaten.

* Maybe in the second half of the course Professor Dolf has solutions with Pb2+, AsO42- etc. They have to remove the toxic heavy metal by adding the correct soluble ionic compound. Maybe there could be a bridge that expands over a chasm each time they correctly remove the toxic ion. It they donâ€™t remove them all correctly, they can try to jump over chasm, but always fall in.

* When they get all of the way across the course, they earn a prize and go back to the main scenario.
